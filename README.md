This file presents a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset (train.csv) from Kaggle. The goal is to identify which categories of passengers were most likely to survive the disaster by applying data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis techniques using Python and pandas.

Key highlights include:

Analysis of survival rates by class, gender, age group, family size, and title.

Feature engineering to create new attributes such as Family Size, Title, and AgeGroup.

Handling of missing data with class- and gender-based imputation for age and mode imputation for embarked location.

Insightful findings that show first-class women with small families had the highest chances of survival, influenced by social policies and lifeboat access.

The results offer meaningful interpretations supported by data, helping understand the human factors behind Titanic's tragic outcomes.
